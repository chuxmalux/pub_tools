A Data Pool is an open protocol local area network (LAN) for displaying and sharing data on CitiNets that anyone can use. The open protocols were created by Ziggurat in 2030 in order to provide the Night City CitiNet with increased usability. 

These information servers and exchange systems are designed for open use exclusively within the limits of a city. Data Pools create free, open content through the collaborative efforts of a community of users. 

In design, they are similar to the hyperâ€“stack "page" system attempted and then abandoned for the NET in the early 90's. They are free to use by anyone who has access to a Data Term or an Agent.
